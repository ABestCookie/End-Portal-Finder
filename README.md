## 把項目拉到本地該做的事(開發者專用)
>開發者用的，看不懂就建議別動了

### 1️⃣ 使用 Git 將專案複製到本地

```
git clone https://github.com/ABestCookie/End-Portal-Finder.git
cd End-Portal-Finder
```

### 2️⃣ 安裝依賴套件（建議搭配虛擬環境，如uv之類的）

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ 執行主程式

```
python ui.py
```

## 如果你是普通人的話

電腦的話看右邊，你應該會找到一個叫releases的東西，點下去自己選檔案下載👍

~~手機的話你不可能用這東西，我就不講了~~
